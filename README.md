# Chessboard_Tour
My solution to the knight's tour problem. No recursion is used - consecutive knight's positions are put on a stack instead.
The solution contains two versions:
  1. the regular one
  2. one that uses Warnsdorfs rule: The knight is moved so that it always proceeds to the square from which the knight will have the fewest onward moves. Using such heuristic makes the problem solvable in linear time.
